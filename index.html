                <h3>A student</h3>
                <p>I am currently a student at Virginia Polytechnic and State University studying Computer Science in
                    the College of Engineering. My expected graduation is May 2021. So far, I have taken courses such as
                    Software Design, Data Structures, Algorithms,
                    Computer Organization, Mobile Software Development (Android), Problem Solving, Discrete Mathematics,
                    and Applied Combinatorics.

                <h3>An engineer</h3>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have always liked solving problems. I was finally able to pursue this
                    passion of mine when I started studying computer science at Virginia Tech. Through classes and
                    projects, I learned essential skills such as
                    teamwork, communication, time management, etc. I am excited to put these skills to
                    use in my future jobs.

                    <h3>External Sort</h3>
                    <p>I completed the following project in CS 3114: Data Structures and Algorithms. For this project, I
                        implemented an external sorting algorithm for binary data. The input data for this project
                        consisted of several blocks of data, where
                        each block is 8,192 bytes. Each block contains a series of records, where a single record is 16
                        bytes long. The first 8 bytes is a non-negative integer value for the record ID and the second
                        8-byte field is a double value for this
                        key. My job was to sort the input file in ascending order of key values using 8 block min heap
                        based replacement selection sort and multiway merge sort.

                    <h3>MIPS32 Assembler</h3>
                    <p> I completed the following project in CS 2506: Computer Organization II. I implemented a subset
                        of the MIPS 32 assembly language. The assembler was implemented in C and executed on Linux. My
                        assembler took a file written in that subset
                        of the MIPS32 assembly language, and wrote an output file containing the corresponding MIPS32
                        machine code in text format. The output was written in binary. My assembler also kept track of
                        the addresses of variables and labels
                        in the assembly code.
