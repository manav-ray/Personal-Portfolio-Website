                <h3>A student</h3>
                <p>I am currently a student at Virginia Polytechnic and State University studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. My expected graduation is May 2021. So far, I have taken courses such as Software Design, Data Structures, Algorithms,
                    Computer Organization, Mobile Software Development (Android), Problem Solving, Discrete Mathematics, and Applied Combinatorics.

                <h3>An engineer</h3>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have always liked solving problems. I was finally able to pursue this passion of mine when I started studying computer science at Virginia Tech. Through classes and projects, I learned essential skills such as
                    teamwork, communication, time management, etc. I am also extremely excited to put these skills to use when I start my internship as a Software Engineer at Fannie Mae for the summer of 2020.

                <h3>External Sort</h3>
                <p>I completed the following project in CS 3114: Data Structures and Algorithms. For this project, I implemented an external sorting algorithm for binary data. The input data for this project consisted of several blocks of data, where each
                    block is 8,192 bytes. Each block contains a series of records, where a single record is 16 bytes long. The first 8 bytes is a non-negative integer value for the record ID and the second 8-byte field is a double value for this key.
                    My job was to sort the input file in ascending order of key values using 8 block min heap based replacement selection sort and multiway merge sort.

                <h3>MIPS32 Assembler</h3>
                <p> I completed the following project in CS 2506: Computer Organization II. I implemented a subset of the MIPS 32 assembly language. The assembler was implemented in C and executed on Linux. My assembler took a file written in that subset
                    of the MIPS32 assembly language, and wrote an output file containing the corresponding MIPS32 machine code in text format. For instance, the input "add $s1, $s0, $s1" would have the corresponding output "00000010000100011000100000100000
                    ". My assembler also kept track of the addresses of variables and labels in the assembly code.
